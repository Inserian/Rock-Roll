# Rock-Roll
This Python scrypt uses twitter api to connect directly to GPTC and send new rock and roll lyrics every hour to a specified twitter account.
This scrypt is a blank canvas, all you need to do is edit what functions you want GPTC to send and insert your api credentials for both twitter and GPTC.
