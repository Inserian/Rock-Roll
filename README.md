# Rock-Roll
This Python scrypt uses twitter api to connect directly to GPTC and send new rock and roll lyrics every hour to a specified twitter account.
This scrypt is a blank canvas, all you need to do is edit what functions you want GPTC to send and insert your api credentials for both twitter and GPTC.

    Use the Twitter API to authenticate and connect to the account where the songs will be posted.

    After the song is generated, use the Twitter API to post the song as a tweet on the designated account.
